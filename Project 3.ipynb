This shows that the classifier was consistent in its abilities to determine gender. The high accuracy of over 70% showed that the model was relatively good at determining if the name was male or female, but it could be improved upon.\n",
    "- When the classifier was trained a second time using more features, the accuracy on the test set was again nearly identical to the performance on the dev-test set. The difference in accuracies was slightly more than the first classifier, but they were still very close. This shows the classifier was also consistent in its abilities to determine gender. It did not improve much compared to the original classifier, but it still showed a strong accuracy.\n",

    "- This was expected based on the results from the textbook. The accuracies were very similar in the example shown.\n",
    "- Without consideration for the textbook, we assumed the dev-test set would have a similar accuracy to the test set in the first classification model because neither set was used to train the model. The model should be consistent across many different data sets. Also, we assumed the dev-test set would be slightly more accurate than the test set in the second classification model because the errors made on the dev-test set were used to help decide on the features added in the second model. Therefore, the results were also as expected even without considering the accuracies shown in the textbook."

Notably, both models possess a bias toward more often correctly predicting names that belong to female observations compared to males; however, this difference appears to be somewhat more pronounced in the random forest model. Perhaps the disparity in predicted outcomes is a result of features that were not explored in our models, such as vowel and consonant composition. Clearly, more complex models should be constructed for the construction of an enhanced, generalizable classification model."
